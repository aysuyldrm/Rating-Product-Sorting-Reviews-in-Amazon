E-Commerce Product Rating & Review Analysis
Project Overview

This project enhances e-commerce product evaluation by addressing outdated ratings and unreliable review rankings. Traditional averages misrepresent current product quality, and raw helpful votes can be misleading.

Problem

Simple average ratings give equal weight to old and new reviews (df["overall"].mean()), distorting current product quality.

Review ranking by total votes favors popular but possibly biased reviews.

Solution

Implemented time-based weighted ratings (time_based_weighted_average()) to emphasize recent reviews.

Engineered negative votes (helpful_no = total_vote - helpful_yes).

Applied scoring metrics:

Positive–negative vote difference (score_up_down_diff())

Average helpfulness ratio (score_average_rating())

Wilson Lower Bound (WLB) for statistically reliable ranking (wilson_lower_bound())
