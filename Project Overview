This project focuses on improving the reliability and accuracy of product ratings and review rankings in an e-commerce environment, where customer trust and purchase decisions are highly sensitive to user-generated feedback. The core motivation behind the project is that traditional rating and review systems often fail to reflect the true and current quality of a product, leading to misleading evaluations and poor user experience.

The first problem addressed is product rating calculation. In many platforms, product ratings are computed using a simple arithmetic mean of all historical ratings (df["overall"].mean()). However, this approach ignores the temporal dimension of user feedback. As a result, outdated reviews can dominate the rating and misrepresent the product’s current performance. To solve this, I implemented a time-based weighted average rating system (time_based_weighted_average()), where reviews are grouped based on recency using day_diff quantiles. More recent reviews are assigned higher weights (w1=50, w2=25, w3=15, w4=10), ensuring that the calculated rating better reflects current user sentiment and product quality.

The second major problem involves review ranking. Ranking reviews solely based on the total number of helpful votes (total_vote) introduces statistical bias and makes the system vulnerable to manipulation. Reviews with a small number of biased votes may rank disproportionately high, while statistically reliable reviews may be overlooked. To address this, I first engineered a missing signal by calculating negative votes (helpful_no = total_vote - helpful_yes). I then implemented multiple scoring mechanisms to evaluate reviews from different perspectives.

These included the positive–negative vote difference (score_up_down_diff()), the average helpfulness ratio (score_average_rating()), and most importantly, the Wilson Lower Bound (WLB) score (wilson_lower_bound()), which accounts for both vote ratio and sample size under a defined confidence level. By ranking reviews using the Wilson Lower Bound (df.sort_values("wilson_lower_bound", ascending=False)), the system prioritizes statistically reliable reviews rather than merely popular ones.

As a result, the project delivers a fair, robust, and manipulation-resistant evaluation framework. Product ratings become more accurate and up-to-date, while review rankings surface the most trustworthy and informative feedback. This approach enhances customer confidence, improves decision-making on product detail pages, and supports sustainable growth for both sellers and the e-commerce platform.
